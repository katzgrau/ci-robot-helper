# The Robot Helper

CodeIgniter comes with a Captcha implementation, but sometimes you just need
something quicker and easier, like a simple math question.

This spark is in use on the [GetSparks.org Registration Page](http://getsparks.org/register).

## Usage

The spark doesn't autoload anything, so you'll need to load the spark and
the robot helper.

The spark's usage  involves on two methods: `get_spam_check` and `spam_check_answer`.

`get_spam_check()` returns a 2-element array. The first element contains a question
for the user as a string. The second element contains the answer.

    class Users extends Controller
    {
        # .. Other stuff ..

        public function register()
        {
            $this->load->spark('robot-helper/VERSION');
            $this->load->helper('robot');

            $submitted   = $this->input->post('submit');
            $math_answer = $this->input->post('math_answer');

            if($submitted)
            {
                if(spam_check_answer($math_answer))
                {
                    # Register the user, and redirect to the account page
                }
                else
                {
                    # Uh oh, the user didn't pass
                }
            }

            # Call get_spam_check(), which is created by robot-helper
            list($question, $answer) = get_spam_check();

            $data['spam_question'] = $question;
            $data['spam_answer']   = $answer;

            $this->load->view('users/register', $data);
        }

        # .. Other stuff ..
    }
